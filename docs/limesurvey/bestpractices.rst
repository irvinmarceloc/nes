Best Practices and Recommendations
==================================

1. Recommendations on Array Dual Scale issues (they should always be used with the same answer options on both scales).

2. Whenever possible, give preference to issues of mandatory completion.

3. Include Not informed/Not evaluated option, instead of leaving the question unfilled. The intention is to leave the null values only for issues that do not apply.

4. Preferably do not include "file upload" questions in your surveys, because NES canâ€™t retrieve files uploaded on LimeSurvey. Alternatively, use the :ref:`additional NES data functionality <attach-additional-files>`.
