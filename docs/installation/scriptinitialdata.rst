Script for creating initial data
================================

After installing NES, all you have in the database is a single user. However, there are some data that all NES databases should have, such as certain groups of users, options related to fields that describe  participants, and stimulus types. To facilitate the process of writing these data into the database, the development team has created a script. Current version of NES offers only a script that creates these data in Portuguese. An English version of the script will be available in the next version of NES.
