Participant Questionnaires
==========================

Questionnaires is the tab where you can view or add participant's answers to questionnaires (fills).

.. _participant-questionnaires-tab:

Participant Questionnaires Tab
------------------------------

You can visit the :ref:`Participants` page to understand how to navigate between tabs.

These questionnaires types are discussed in the :ref:`questionnaires` page.

.. _list-of-questionnaire-fills:

List of Questionnaire Fills
```````````````````````````

This section shows a list of all questionnaire that the participant has already filled and the ones that the participant still has to answer. 

.. image:: ../../_img/participant_questionnaires_entrance_evaluation.png

In this list you see 3 different fields per line:

* Questionnaire - the name of the questionnaire;
* Fills - the date that the participant filled the questionnaire (default value is the date you started giving the answers);
* Message - this is an indicator that informs if the participant filled the questionnaire. The message is yellow if the questionnaire is incomplete and still has to be filled, and it is green if the participant completely filled the questionnaire at least once. 

As an example, in the image above, you see 2 questionnaires:

* the first questionnaire has 3 fills, the first two fills are completed and the third is incomplete
* the second questionnaire has not been filled before, so there is no information of fills, but the message that informs a lack of fill (in yellow).

If the questionnaire is completely filled (green message), the `Fills` field becomes a link that takes you to the screen that shows the answers given by the participant.

.. _list-og-experiment-questionnaires:

List of Experiment Questionnaires
`````````````````````````````````

.. image:: ../../_img/participant_questionnaires_of_experiments.png

This list is a bit different from the list of questionnaires fills, because it shows informations about questionnaires that are specific used within experiments.

The experiments questionnaires section lists the following fields (sorted by date):

* :ref:`Research project <studies>`
* :ref:`experiments`
* :ref:`group-of-participants`
* :ref:`Questionnaire <managing-steps-for-experimental-protocol>`
* Fill (date that a questionnaire was filled)
* message (indicator that informs if the participant filled the questionnaire, as explained `here <list-of-questionnaire-fills>`_)

Even if you are in the :ref:`edition mode <creating-and-editing-a-participant>` you can only see information here. If you want to add/continue/remove an experiment questionnaire fill, see :ref:`questionnaires-of-the-experimental-protocol`.

.. _viewing-a-questionnaire-of-experiment:

* Fill information - questionnaire name, participant who answered the questionnaire, responsible for filling it, and date that questionnaire was filled.
