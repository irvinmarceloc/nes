Researchers of an Experiment
============================

The researchers participating of a study may not be involved in all experiments, being necessary to attribute them by experiment. To add researchers to an experiment, they have to be registered at NES system. To do that, you can visit the :ref:`researchers menu <researchers>`. To add researchers to an experiment, you have to click at `Insert new` button at the `Researchers` section at the experiment.

A list with all researchers registered at NES will be shown. You may mark each researcher checkbox to attribute them to the experiment or you can click at `Select all` checkbox to select all of them. Once you select the researchers for that experiment, you can click in the `Save` button.
