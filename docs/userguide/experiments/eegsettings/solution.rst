Solution Settings
=================

In the majority of electroencephalogram (EEG) examinations, scalp electrodes that are not in direct contact with the tissue are used; the indirect contact is established by an electrolyte bridge formed by an electrode jelly applied between the electrode and the skin. The electrochemical properties of the metal/liquid junction and the skin/electrolyte junction cause a steady electrical potential and an electrical impedance in the connection between tissue and apparatus. Both the electrode potential and the electrode impedance can restrict the performance of the recording system. This page allows to registered the kind of solution used in the experiment.
This setting allows to register the solution used in the experiment. The following information can be registered:

* :ref:`manufacturer`: The manufacturer of the solution used in the experiment.
* :ref:`Identification <solution>`: The name of the solution. This can be filtered by manufacturer. 
When an identification is selected, the description field shows information about the solution used.

.. note:: If the manufacturer and/or Identification does not exist, it has to be added in the :ref:`equipment-set-up` module.
