EEG Settings
============

NES allows to register all the information related to settings and parameters of the equipments and materials involving in the acquisition of EEG raw data. The settings that are contemplated in this functionality are:

* :ref:`eeg-amplifier-settings`
* :ref:`solution-settings`
* :ref:`eeg-filter-settings`
* :ref:`eeg-electrode-layout-settings`

The EEG setting is based on the Minimum Information guidelines proposed by the Neuroscience community in MINI `[Gibson, F. et al: Minimum information about a neuroscience investigation (MINI):electrophysiology. Nat. Precedings. (2008)]` and MINEMO `[Frishko, G. et al: Minimal Information for Neural Electromagnetic Ontologies (MINEMO): A standards-compliant method for analysis and integration of event related potentials (ERP) data. Standards in genomic sciences. 5.2, 211-223 (2011)`. This guidelines are checklists which define the minimum information a researcher needs to report when publishing the results of an experiment.

EEG setting offers the following functionalities:

.. _add-eeg-setting:

Add EEG Setting
---------------

To add a new EEG setting, you have to register the name and some description about the setting registered. Both information are mandatory.

.. _edit-eeg-setting:

Edit EEG Setting
----------------

When a EEG setting is added, the information registered is shown. Settings are shown in a list form below the EEG setting information and each item of the list correspond to a specific EEG setting.
On this page is possible to edit the name and description of the current EEG setting, add a specific EEG setting for a equipment or material and/or delete all EEG settings for the current experiment, clicking in the _Delete EEG Setting_ button.

.. _visualize-eeg-setting:

Visualize EEG Setting
---------------------

When a EEG setting is added, the list shows the main informations about the EEG setting registered. A specific EEG setting can be deleted at any time.
