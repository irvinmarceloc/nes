EMG Electrode Settings
======================

The electrode settings menu allows you to register the type of electrode used in the EMG experiment as the manufacturer, the model, the placement details and other remarks that you consider relevant for describe the electrode. In addition, you can describe the amplifier and/or pre-amplifier setting used with the electrode.
The fields that are part of this settings are:

* Electrode type : this indicates if the electrode is surface, intramuscular or needle.
* Electrode model: in this field you must to select the model of electrode used, this model is defined in :ref:`electrode-model` menu.
* Electrode placement: here you select the system used in the placement of the electrode, this system is defined in the :ref:`electrode-placement-system` menu. The system shows details about the start posture, orientation, fixation on the skin, reference electrode and clinical test.
* Remarks: here you can register some additional information about the experiment.

In the picture below is showed a screenshot of this menu:

EMG Amplifier Settings
----------------------

Each electrode works with a amplifier or pre-amplifier, the description of this settings are in the following sections:

The EMG amplifier settings page allows to register settings about the EMG amplifier used in the experiment.

* :ref:`manufacturer`: The name of the amplifier manufacturer.
* :ref:`Identification <amplifier>`: The model name of the amplifier. When the Identification is selected some informations about the amplifier are shown, such as the description and gain.
* Gain setted: In this item is registered the gain used in the experiment. An amplifier multiplies an input voltage by a constant usually lying in the range of up to 1000000. The amplification factor is referred to as gain and may be expressed as Vout/ Vin. The unit of the gain is the decibel (dB): dB = 20 X log(Vout/Vin).
* Analog filter settings: in this setting you can register the configuration used for the analog filter.

.. note:: If the manufacturer and/or Identification does not exist, it must to be added in the :ref:`equipment-set-up` module.

EMG Pre-amplifier Settings
--------------------------
The EMG Pre-amplifier settings page allows to register settings about the EMG amplifier used in the experiment. The information registered here are:

* :ref:`manufacturer`: The name of the amplifier manufacturer.
* :ref:`Identification <amplifier>`: The model name of the amplifier. When the Identification is selected some informations about the amplifier are shown, such as the description and gain.
* Gain setted: In this item is registered the gain used in the experiment. An amplifier multiplies an input voltage by a constant usually lying in the range of up to 1000000. The amplification factor is referred to as gain and may be expressed as Vout/ Vin. The unit of the gain is the decibel (dB): dB = 20 X log(Vout/Vin).
* Analog filter settings: in this setting you can register the configuration used for the analog filter.

.. note:: If the manufacturer and/or Identification does not exist, it must to be added in the :ref:`equipment-set-up` module.
