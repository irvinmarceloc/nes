Recording Settings
==================

NES describes the actual, adjustable, parameters of the hardware that may change with each recording or dataset. For example, the sample rate of a data-acquisition or the settings of a filter.
The settings that are supported by NES are: 

* :ref:`eeg-settings`
* :ref:`emg-settings`
* :ref:`tms-settings`

Each setting describes the used values of variable properties of hardware components that are part of each experiment.
