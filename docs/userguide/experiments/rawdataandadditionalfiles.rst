Raw data and additional files
=============================

NES allows to attach files by each participant in several types of data formats. These can be raw data obtained from collect of EEG, EMG or TMS, or additional files related with each step of the experimental protocol.
Once the group of participants and their experimental protocol is determined, the system will show, each participant by row, as is shown in the picture below. The list of registered participants includes a link (represented by the paperclip) to a screen that allows you to attach the file that stores the term of consent signed by the participant. In case the experimental protocol includes questionnaires, a column named `Completed questionnaires` is shown with a link to fill the questionnaires and a graphical representation of the number of filled questionnaires for that participant. If included in the experimental protocol, EEG, EMG, TMS and Generic data collections are shown in the last column as well as a link to attach additional files. This screen is shown in the picture below.
