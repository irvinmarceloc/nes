Studies
===========
NES offers the possibility of creating studies.

List of Studies
---------------
To access the list of studies already registered in the system, click on the `Study` menu item. This screen allows the creation of a new study, the import of a study (previously exported by NES) or the visualization of an existing study.

Creating and Editing a Study
----------------------------
A study contains:

* A title (obligatory);
* A description (obligatory);
* A start date (obligatory);
* An end date;
* A list of keywords;
* A list of colaborators;
* A list of experiments; and
* An owner (obligatory).

However, while creating a new study, the screen asks only for the title, description, and term of a study. Those are also the fields that can be updated if you click the `Edit` button in the visualization screen. Keywords and experiments can be added while visualizing a study. During creation, the logged user becomes the owner of the study. The owner cannot be changed. Only authorized users can update a study, which means the owner of the study or users with permission to change the study (See :ref:`permissions` for more information).

Visualizing a Study
-------------------
You can see more information about an existing study by clicking on its title in the list of studies. While viewing a study, you can delete it by clicking the `Delete` button. However, this button is visible only for the users that have permission to update a study.

Importing an study
------------------
You can import an study with one experiment in the studies listing page through the `Import Study/Experiment` button. A page will load asking for the .zip file with all the necessary data to create a new study and experiment. This .zip file can be generated by exporting an experiment in the experiment list of the study (see more details about this list bellow).

Keywords of a study
-------------------
You can manage keywords while viewing the information about a study. To add a new keyword, simply type the desired keyword in the text field on the `Keywords` section. The system suggests keywords already in use by other studies that are still not in use in the current study, or the creation of a new one. You should then select one of the options from the list. It is not possible to include more than one keyword at the same time. To remove a keyword, simply click the :x: button associated to it. Again, only users that have permission to update a study can add or remove keywords. Non-authorized users can't see the text field.

Experiments of a study
----------------------
A study may have multiple :ref:`experiments`. Again, only users that have :ref:`permissions` to update a study can add experiments. Non-authorized users can't see the `Insert new` button.

A list with all experiments that belongs to the study will be shown. You may make a copy of an experiment by clicking on the `Copy experiment` icon. A modal will pop up and you have to choose if you want to copy the experiment with or without data. You may also get a PDF version of the experiment by clicking on the `Create PDF` icon and you can export an experiment by clicking the `Export experiment` icon. This will generate a .zip file with all the necessary structure of the experiment that can be later imported in other study or NES installation along with data collections of the participants of the experiment if there is any. And finally, if you can import a experiment from a .zip file previously exported by NES into the study you are visualizing if you have the right permissions for it.

Exporting/Importing a Experiment of a Study
-------------------------------------------

In the list of experiments of a study (see image above), you can click the `Export experiment` button of an experiment and generate a .zip file with all the necessary data to create a copy of this experiment into another study or NES installation along with participants' personal data and data collections if there is any.

Still on this page, you can import an experiment into this study by clicking the `Import experiment` button. A new page will load where you have to upload the .zip file of the experiment exported by NES. Once you upload it and send it, if there'is any conflict between participants in the database, you will be asked to choose either if you want to update the participants in the database or create new ones. After that, a new study will be created, with new groups, experimental protocols and data collections.
