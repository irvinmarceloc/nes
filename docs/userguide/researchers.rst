Researchers
===========

If you have the right :ref:`permissions`, NES allows you to register the researchers that are working in your studies. While you are registering the researcher, you can choose whether or not that researcher can access the study at NES. If so, an username, a password and a profile will be required. NES also allows you to register the Institutions involved in your studies. The instructions of these functionalities are presented below.

.. _list-of-researchers:

List of Researchers and Institutions
------------------------------------

To access the list of researchers and institutions registered in the system, click in the `Researchers` menu item. This screen allows the creation of a new researcher or institution or the visualization of the existing ones.

The researchers are organized in a list showing their names, e-mails, institution they belong to and their usernames if they have access to NES (if they don`t have the access, the username field is filled with "---").

Creating and Editing a User
---------------------------
A researcher register contains:

* A first name (obligatory);
* A last name (obligatory);
* An e-mail (obligatory);
* An institution.

If the researcher must have access the system, you have to choose `Yes, a username and password must be configured` in the `Can this researcher access the system?` field. The default option to that question is `No`. 

By clicking `Yes, a username and password must be configured` two sections appear, the first one to configure the username and password and the second one for you to choose the profile for the researcher. See :ref:`script-for-creating-initial-data` to know the permissions each profile has.

All these fields can be set while creating or updating a user. You have always to inform the password twice, and it has to have at least 8 characters, including at least one upper case letter, digit or a special character. An explanation about roles is given in :ref:`group-of-users-roles`. Only authorized users can update a user (See :ref:`permissions` for more information).

Each institution have a name, is settled in a country, has an acronym and may have a parent institution. The informations that can be registered in this item are:

* Name: the official name of the institution (obligatory);
* Acronym: the word(s) or name formed as an abbreviation of the institution name (obligatory);
* Country: the country to which the institution belongs (obligatory); and
* Parent: the parent institution to which the institution belongs, if it exists.

Logging in and out

To log out, you have to click in your username at the top-right of the page and choose the `Exit` option.

Changing the password
---------------------
In the same menu where the option to log out is located, you can access the screen to change your password. You have to inform your current password once and the new password twice. The rules to create the password are the same as indicated in the section about `Creating and Editing a User`_.

After confirming, you are redirected to the home screen.

Resetting the password
----------------------

If you forgot your password and no longer can log in, you can reset your password. In the log in screen, click the `Forgot my password` link. Your registered e-mail will be asked, so that a message can be sent to you with a link that allows you to set up a new password.

After typing your e-mail address, you will see a message explaining about the e-mail with instructions on how to proceed. Even if you typed a wrong e-mail address, you will see the same message, however, no e-mail will be sent.

.. image:: ../_img/reset_password_message.png

After clicking the link in the e-mail you received, you will see a screen where you will be asked to type your new password twice. Rules to create a password in this screen are more restrictive. The more complex your new password, higher the chances that it gets accepted. A possible password has at least 8 characters, including upper case letters and digits or special characters.

Then, you will see a success screen with a button that takes you back to the log in screen.
