EEG Electrode Localization System
=================================

NES allows to register the system of the placement where the electrode are localized. The system can be standardized or specifically designed by a manufacturer.
On this page can be registered information about the Electrode Localization System used in the acquisition of EEG raw data.

----------------------------------------------

This page shows the list of electrode localization system contemplated by NES. By clicking a item of the list you can edit this item.

Add electrode localization system
---------------------------------

For adding a new electrode localization system, you must register the following information:

* Name: the name of the localization system. This information is mandatory.
* Description: some description about the system registered.
* Map image file: a file with the image of the electrodes localization used by the system registered.

Insert the coordinates of the electrodes
----------------------------------------

After adding an electrode localization system, NES shows a table with the positions and coordinates of each electrode in the system. This table should be filled with the coordinates of each electrode in the registered image file. The next picture shows a example of this screen:

NES offers two ways to register these coordinates: using a form and using a image. 
The next picture shows the screen with the form that should be filled.
