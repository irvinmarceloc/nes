EEG Electrode Net Cap
=====================
NES allows to register information about of the electrodes or set of electrodes used in the acquisition of EEG raw data. On this page is possible to register for each kind of electrode (individual or cap) its :ref:`manufacturer`, identification, description, serial number, the type or :ref:`model of the electrode <electrode-model>`, the :ref:`system localization <eeg-electrode-localization-system>` used and if a cap is used.

Add electrode net
-----------------

To add a new electrode net, you must register the following information:

* :ref:`manufacturer`: the name of the manufacturer of the electrode net; (obligatory)
* Identification: the name of the model of the electrode net registered; (obligatory)
* Description: some description about the electrode net registered;
* Serial number: serial number of the electrode net;
* :ref:`Electrode Model Default <electrode-model>`: the electrode model by default of the electrode net registered; (obligatory)
* :ref:`Localization system <eeg-electrode-localization-system>`: the name of the system of localization used by this electrode net.
* Is a cap: information about if the electrode net registered is a cap (checked) or a set of individual electrodes (no checked).
* :ref:`material`: this information appear if 'Is a cap' is selected. Here adds the material in which the cap is made.
