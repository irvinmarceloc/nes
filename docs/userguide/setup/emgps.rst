EMG Placement System
====================

NES allows to register a system for placements the electrodes in the EMG experiments. SENIAM is a example of a placement system.

View the list of EMG electrode placement system
-----------------------------------------------

This page shows the list of EMG electrode placement system registered in NES. By clicking a item of the list you can edit this item.

Add a EMG Placement System
--------------------------

To add a new EMG placement system, you have to insert the name of the system registered and maybe a description.
The picture below show a example of this screen:

After saving a new EMG placement system, you can insert a electrode placement. There are three categories of electrode placements: surface, intramuscular and needle. You must choose one of them, as is shown the example in the next picture.

.. _add-a-surface-emg-electrode-placement:

Add a Surface EMG electrode placement
-------------------------------------

The informations that should be registered when inserting a surface electrode placement are the following:
* Muscle subdivision: select the subdivision of the muscle that will be descreved. 
* Location description: the description of the localization where the electrode should to be placed.
* Start posture: this information indicates the posture of the participant in the beginning of the experiment.
* Orientation: this information indicates the orientation of the electrode on the skin of the participant.
* Fixation on the skin: this indicates how the electrode will be fixed on the skin.
* Reference electrode: the electrode that will be configured as reference.
* Clinical test: the description of the test that will be made during the experiment.
* Photo: a photo of the muscle described.

.. _add-a-intramuscular-emg-electrode-placement:

Add a Intramuscular EMG electrode placement
-------------------------------------------

The informations that should be registered when inserting a intramuscular electrode placement are the following:
* Muscle subdivision: the subdivision of the muscle to be described. 
* Location description: the description of the localization where the electrode should to be placed.
* Method of insertion: the description of the method that will be used for the insertion of the intramuscular electrode.
* Depth of insertion: indication of the depth of the insertion of the intramuscular electrode.
* Photo: a photo of the muscle described.

.. _add-a-needle-emg-electrode-placement:

Add a Needle EMG electrode placement
------------------------------------

The informations that should be registered when inserting a needle electrode placement are the following:
* Muscle subdivision: select the subdivision of the muscle that will be described. 
* Location description: the description of the localization where the electrode should to be placed.
* Depth of insertion: this information indicates which will be the depth of the insertion of the needle electrode.
* Photo: a photo of the muscle described.
